Prerequisites
------------
* Expects a MMS/PyMongo compatible python version to be installed
* Expects pymongo to be installed
* If srvany.exe is not packaged then Windows NT Resource Kit should be installed and its path is read from the registry
* Powershell script execution to be turned (this is just not for us. it is for any powershell script)

Install Prerequisites
---------------------
* Install python 2.7 using the Windows Installer. Ensure that you use the 32 bit installer and not 64 bit.
* Install pymongo using the Windows Installer from pypi. Ensure you pick the appropriate version. 
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/2.0.1

Enable Powershell Script Execution
----------------------------------
* Open the Windows Powershell by right-clicking its icon in the Start bar and selecting Run as Administrator
* Type `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` and agree when prompted about changing the policy

Specifying a Proxy Server
-------------------------
If the MMS agent needs a proxy server to connect outside, specify it in the HTTPS_Proxy environment variable
 as http://proxyservername:port


Sevice Installation
-------------------
* Unzip the contents into the same folder containing your MMS scripts such as agent.py
* The script reads python path from windows registry if not specified on command line
* If multiple python installations are present edit the bat file to specify the path of the python install to work
* Run mongommsinstall.bat from an administrator command window
* This will install the windows service and start it
* If you stop the windows service, the agent will stop

Uninstall
------------
- Stop the "MongoDB MMS" windows service
- Run "sc delete mongomms"
